# Writing Processes to Writing Quality Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for the "Linking Writing Processes to Writing Quality" Kaggle competition. The dataset and competition details can be found on the Kaggle competition page: [Linking Writing Processes to Writing Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/linking-writing-processes-to-writing-quality).

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between writing processes and writing quality. The analysis involves hypothesis testing, specifically using a Z-test for the first hypothesis and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) for the second hypothesis. Additionally, extensive preprocessing steps were performed on the data as mentioned in the Kaggle competition details.

## Kaggle Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle: [Linking Writing Processes to Writing Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/linking-writing-processes-to-writing-quality). Please refer to the Kaggle competition page for details on the dataset and the problem statement.

## Hypotheses and Analysis Techniques

1. **Z-Test for the First Hypothesis:** Our analysis involves a Z-test to investigate the first hypothesis related to writing processes.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) for the Second Hypothesis:** We utilized MLR to explore the relationship between multiple variables, linking writing processes to writing quality.

## Preprocessing

Significant preprocessing steps were undertaken as outlined in the Kaggle competition details. This included handling missing data, normalization, and any other steps necessary to prepare the data for analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kudos07/Data-Analysis---Linking-Writing-processes-to-Writing-Quality.git
